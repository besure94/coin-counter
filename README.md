## Description

This application counts the numbers of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies for an amount of change. It currently lacks a UI, as this was a project I worked on to practice writing closures and recursive function.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Select the green "Code" button and select "create a new repository".
* In the terminal, go to your project folder and run the command `$ npm install` to install node_modules.
* Run the command `$ npm run build` to bundle together JS files.
* Enter the command `$ npm run start` to start a live development server.
* Enter the command `$ npm run lint` to check for errors.

## Known Bugs

None.
